what is Big-O notation in javascript
Big O Notation — Time Complexity in Javascript. We use a shorthand mathematical notation to describe the efficiency of an algorithm is Big O Notation, The letter O is used because the rate of growth of a function is also called its order*/



/*
A call stack is a data structure used by the JavaScript engine to manage execution contexts. The call stack uses a principle known as the LIFO (last-in-first-out) principle and whatever is at the top of the call stack will get executed first, then popped off the stack, until the stack is empty.*/
