20. What is the difference between "=", "==", and "==="?

1)blocked scope
2)additional assignment operator
3)undefined, null, NaN, "", 0, false of Course 
4)undefined
5)Strings, numbers, booleans, undefined, null
6)&& is used to perform and operation means if anyone the expression/Condition evaluates the false whole things false
  || is used to perform and operation means if anyone the expression/Condition evaluates the true whole things true
7)Non-primitive data types are called reference types because they refer to objects. The main difference between primitive and non-primitive data types are:
 Primitive types are predefined (already defined) in Java. Non-primitive types are created by the programmer and is not defined by Java (except for String ).
8) a condition followed by a ? colon :
9)var and let are both used for variable declaration in javascript but the difference between them is that var is function scoped and let is block scoped.
  var is function scoped let is blocked scoped
10)break or boolean variable names are not valid. JavaScript variable names should not start with a numeral (0-9). They must begin with a letter or an underscore character.
   For example, 123test is an invalid variable name but _123test is a valid one.
11)
12)Basically, the difference between function scope and block scope is that in a language that uses function scope, 
   any variables declared within a function are visible anywhere within that same function
13) the collection of a series of technologies needed to complete a project.
14)Binary operator deals with two operands and one operator(an Arithmetic operator). 
   Ternary operator deals with three operands and two operator (it is an logical expression).
15)Arithmetic operator are of two types: Unary Operators: Operators that operates or works with a single operand are unary operators. For example: (++ , â€“) 
   Binary Operators: Operators that operates or works with two operands are binary operators.
16)val
17)Undefined: It occurs when a variable has been declared but has not been assigned with any value. 
   Undeclared: It occurs when we try to access any variable that is not initialized or declared earlier using var or const keyword
